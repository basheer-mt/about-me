        <h1>Mohammad Basheer "Alkiswani"</h1>

        
        <p >Greetings and Welcome to my personal space here in this tremendous world. <br>

            As a Software developer "in the making", I would love to share with you my story 
            of how I arrived to this part of the universe.

             <br><br> As you have already seen from the prompt questions appeared at the beginning ðŸ˜„.

              <br> <br> You know now that I haven't studied programming at the university, it was a long journey 
              from the day I finished high school until the day I started to learn coding. <br> I graduated from 
              high school back in 2004, studied in college for two years, Diploma of Mechatronics Engineering, and 
              started my career in the projects and maintenance, the industrial field. <br> <br> I worked here in 
              Jordan for a year and half, then moved to Saudi Arabia for six years, worked for Procter and Gamble 
              (P&G) till 2014. Then I came back to university, here in Jordan, and finished my Bachelor of 
              Engineering - BE, same major, Mechatronics Engineering. <br> <br>
              I was working in the same period as a Projects and maintenance Manager till January of 2018. 
            <br><br>
            I started another job then, with a foreign company to represent other foreign companies towards 
            Telecommunications Regulatory Commission - Jordan. Still working with them, but I started the journey 
            of learning coding at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, first I started alone on the web, 
            online courses, until I had the opportunity to join the course with ASAC at LTUC, the intensive 
            six months coding course of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Hopefully, I can proceed further 
            as a professional in this field.  
        </p>
        
        <p >Ooh I forgot to mention that I am married and have two children: <br>
            A four-year son, and a two-year daughter. <br>
        </p>
        
        <p >That is enough for today!</p>

        <p >Talk to you soon! Or, you can talk to me whenever you like: <input type="submit" onclick="Talk_to_me()" value="Talk to me!"></p>
